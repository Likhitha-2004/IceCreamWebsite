# IceCreamWebsite
## Project Description  

The Ice Cream Explorer & Order Management Website is a dynamic web application designed to provide a seamless experience for customers to browse a variety of ice cream flavors and place online orders. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive and visually appealing frontend, the backend leverages Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL to handle server-side processing and database management. The platform ensures efficient data storage for customer details, flavor information, and order records while offering a user-friendly interface for navigation and checkout.  

This project highlights core web development concepts, including frontend design, backend integration, and database connectivity. With a focus on scalability and responsiveness, the application can cater to various devices and user needs. Developed as part of a final-year B.Tech project, it showcases the practical implementation of Java-based web technologies and database systems in creating a real-world e-commerce solution.
